I have been asked to speak in a panel at Cloud Native & Security World this October in San Francisco.  Before I speak, I wanted to take some time to reflect on the topic that I'll be talking about - "Why Are People Still Struggling with Cloud?".  In recent years, I've seen some great success in addition to a good amount of failure.  Simply put, cloud isn't easy.

It definitely isn't manually kicking off new EC2 instances via the AWS CLI and running Chef on them.  It's not dropping a big Oracle DB into an m1.xlarge and saying that your databases are now in the cloud.  Taking an existing application as-is, putting it in a Docker container and deploying containers into the cloud isn't cloud adoption either.  Despite all of the talk of companies going "all-in" on cloud, there are a lot of companies that simply aren't seeing the true benefits of actually going all-in.  Each of the cases I mentioned here come from real experiences or stories that I have heard from friends and coworkers.

In order to realize the huge benefits of adopting a cloud strategy, companies need to take a step back and look at their cloud strategy.  While re-platforming may cost more in the short run, the immense benefits will immediately pay off once they're developing on a platform done the right way.  The real question is this - what is the right way to go "all-in on cloud"?

Realizing the full benefits of an all-in cloud strategy involves a decent amount of up-front work.  It means having a platform in place that enables rapid development
